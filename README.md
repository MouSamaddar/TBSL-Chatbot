### üèóÔ∏è How It Works

The chatbot uses **Streamlit** to render a sleek web interface where users can type or speak their queries. Voice inputs are converted to text using `SpeechRecognition` and processed through NLP logic to match relevant answers from the database. The system supports both predefined questions and adaptive keyword responses.
